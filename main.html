<h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p> A person’s passion is what drives everything in this world. From new inventions to simple joys, passion brings people together. In Robin Sloan’s Sourdough, the main character, Lois, connects with those around her because of her newfound passion for sourdough. Lois, after interacting with the Lois Club, a group of women all named Lois, says that while discussing her baking with them, that she “had become interesting” (Sloan 78). This concept runs throughout CultureTrade, where users with different interests make themselves interesting by talking about those interests with others like them. Throughout the book, Lois, through her baking of sourdough, connects with many different people.</p>
