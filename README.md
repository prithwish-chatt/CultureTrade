Mr. Miller 2nd Block

Guys, this is a Github. Github is a software to allow for teams to collaborate in their code and work simeltaneiously at their own free times. It also has the ability to version control, which is really good whenever there is an error on the code. We will have a main code, and for every feature that we work on, we are going to make a branch from the main branch. This will copy the code so that we can work while still having a backup in the main in case if everything goes down south. DO NOT PUSH ANY CHANGES TO THE MAIN BRANCH UNTIL THE PRODUCT OWNER APPROVES THE FEATURE!!!!!

Here are some good practices while using GitHub.

Before starting your work, pull code from the feature branch so that you have the lastest version of the code. When you have finished something or are done for the day, please push your changes into the branch so that others can then work on your code. Whenever pushing your changes, please make sure to put a descriptive message on what you did and why you did it so that in the event of something going wrong, we know where the error occoured.
If 2 people are working at the same time, an error can happen if you both push at the same time. In the event that it occours, please let the team know so that we can work towards fixing that
When pulling or pusing your changes, please make sure that you are on the right file. We do not need your math homework showing up in the GitHub
Here are some useful commands you might need while using GitHub

git clone <repository link>

This is a one time command to make a copy of our repository into your computer

git add .

This is to add any files that the repository isn't filing into the repository's radar. Make sure to do this every time

git commit -m "enter message here"

This is how you can put a message to say why you did what you did. Please do this every time you make changes.

git pull

This is to pull all of the changes that have happened ever since the last time you pulled changes. Please do this every time you sit down to do some work

git push origin <branch name>

This is to push any of your changes into the branch. Do this whenever you are done with something or done for the day with your code.

git status

This is to check the status of all of the documents and if they are added or not. Please do this every time.
